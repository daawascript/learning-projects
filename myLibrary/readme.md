## a simple library

### Project from The Odin Project Full-Stack Javascript Curriculum

The goal is to build a web app that allows the user to keep tracks of the books they have read along the years. The user should be able to input title and/or author, number of pages, and whether they have read the book or not. If the latter is the case, they can indicate when they finished the book and give it a rating from 1 to 5 stars.
Then the user can view all the books they have entered, with an automatically generated cover and completed details about this book.
One key point is to use localStorage or Firebase to keep track of the user's books through different sessions.
